## Overview 
Attendance at the lectures/lab is mandatory, at most 3 may be missed. At each lab, we will do a short test, if you miss it, and don't let me know in time or don't have a doctor's note, it's 0 points.

There will be 7-8 assignments throughout the semester, their submission is mandatory, only 1 may be missed (which then will be counted as 0 points). No sharing of assignments or collaborative work on them is allowed, and will result in 0 points.

We will be using github classrooms for assignments. Join the organization by creating your github.com user

Final grade will be calculated as: 50% short tests, 50% assignments.

Points and grades:
* [0% 50%) : 1
* [51% 65%) : 2
* [66% 75%) : 3
* [76% 85%) : 4
* [86% 100%] : 5
