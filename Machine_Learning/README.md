## Midterm
May 7, 10:15-12:00, Lab 322.

## Lab submissions
For each lab some of the exercises have to be submitted right after the lab (lab work), for the rest (lab assignments), you will have about a week before the submission deadline.

Lab work submissions will only have a pass/fail score.

## Course requirements
Grading is based on three components:

* Lab assignments (25%)
* Midterm (25%)
* Final (50%)

To complete the semester and receive a signature you have to meet two conditions:

1. submit each lab assignment and either achieve at least 25% on each of them or an overall 50% on their sum,
2. pass at least 60% of lab work submissions (to be submitted right after class and scored as pass/fail)
3. achieve at least 50% on the midterm exam, and at least 40% on both parts of it.
