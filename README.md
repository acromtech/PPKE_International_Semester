# PPKE International Semester - Budapest, Hungary (Jan.2024 - Aug.2024)

Welcome to my journey during the International Semester (Jan.2024 - Aug.2024) at [Pázmány Péter Catholic University Faculty of Information Technology and Bionics (PPKE)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KbTyHPxR4smeeifYA) in Budapest, Hungary.

## Overview
During my time at PPKE, I delved into cutting-edge topics in robotics, exploring areas such as bionic robotic models, sensory robotics, parallel programming, and machine learning. This enriching experience not only broadened my academic horizons but also provided invaluable hands-on experience through an internship.

## Internship Experience
As a Laboratory Engineer at the ITK Ányos Jedlik Sensing-Actuating Robotics Laboratory in Budapest, Hungary, I was immersed in the world of prosthetic and exoskeletal research. My primary focus was on understanding and designing infrared sensor-based human-machine interfaces. This involved familiarizing myself with the structural and functional aspects of human hand control, as well as the physiological background of upper limb hemodynamics. I actively participated in ongoing projects, contributing to the production and validation of IR-based interfaces and conducting experimental measurements. Additionally, I developed computational models and algorithms to analyze raw measurement data and compared my findings with existing literature.

## Courses Highlights
Throughout the semester, I engaged with diverse courses tailored to enhance my academic and practical skills:

- **[English for Academic Purposes II](/English/):** Mastering the art of scientific writing and effective presentations, essential for conveying rigorous research.
- **[Parallel Programming](/Parallel_Programming):** Exploring parallel hardware and programming methods, including shared and distributed memory parallelism, and GPU programming.
- **[Sensory Robotics](/Sensory_Robotics/):** Investigating the breadth of robotic sensors, their characteristics, and applications, from basic principles to sensor fusion and machine perception.
- **[Neuromorph Movement Control](/Neuromorph_movement_control/):** Analyzing kinematic problems of multi-joint systems, neural control optimization, and sensory-motor transformations, vital for bionics applications.
- **[Machine Learning](/Machine_Learning/):** Delving into various aspects of machine learning, from data preprocessing to deep learning or reinforcement learning techniques, crucial in today's data-driven world.
- **[Scientific Python](/Scientific_Python/):** Gaining proficiency in utilizing Python for mobile robotics problems (SLAM).

My time at PPKE was transformative, equipping me with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills essential for navigating the rapidly evolving field of robotics and bionics.
