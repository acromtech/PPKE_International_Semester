# Jerk decomposition during upper limb movement
*Neuromorph movement control*

## Joint angles

Compute joint angles from segments 
* Shoulder
* Elbow
* Wrist

The jerk is mathematically the third derivative in time of the position of the end point of the arm. Nervous system control: optimal solution to the problem - principle of minimum jerk
𝐶_𝑗=∫1_0^𝑇▒〖〖𝑝^′′′ (𝑡)〗^𝟐  𝑑𝑡〗 		

Optimatization criteria for multi-joint movements →smoothest trajectory of the endpoint/The joint angles → minimal jerk
Inverz kinematic task → optimal solution → with Jacobi matrix
