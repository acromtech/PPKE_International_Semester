## Lab
Miklós Koller (koller.miklos@itk.ppke.hu);
on Wednesday, 12:15-14:00 and 14:15:16:00; during online education period: MS Teams, if the pandemic ended: in Lab 340/Robotics Lab;
laboratory work should be done in pairs (on the first lecture (8th of February) we will form the measurement pairs);
5 different measurements: infra, depth-camera, optoforce, scanner, ultrasound;
there will be a schedule for each measurement pair:
in the given time-intervall you have to be present in MS Teams, you have to start your solution and you can ask the practice leader;
the deadline for the measurement report to send is the midnight before your next measurement occasion;
during the next measurement occasion I will ask questions regarding your previous report;
the last reports should be finalized within one week, and we will have the necessary discussion about it on the next week's Wednesday (in lab time).

* [Depth-based Image Fusion with RealSense Camera](lab/depth_camera/)
* [IR Distance Measurement with Photodiodes and Phototransistors](lab/infrared/)
* [Terrain Bump Detection with Optoforce 3D Sensor](lab/optoforce/)
* [3D Surface Reconstruction via Laser Scanning and Accelerometer Integration](lab/scanner/)
* [Ultrasound Distance Measurement and Resonance Frequency Exploration](lab/ultrasound/)

## Requirements of the instructor’s signature
5 accepted laboratory reports (there is no midterm).

## Exams
Exam in the examination period includes the entire course material.
There is no restriction in relation with the last exam occasion (on the final week of the exam period (aka. 'retake exam week') you can participate on it as your first Sensory Robotics exam).
The final grade is solely based on the result of the exam:
0 < exam points <= 40 -> unsatisfactory
40 < exam points <= 55 -> satisfactory
55 < exam points <= 70 -> average
70 < exam points <= 85 -> good
85 < exam points <= 100 -> excellent.
The exam has a written part and an optional oral part.
